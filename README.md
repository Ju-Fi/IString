# IString
IString is a library designed to improve the functionality of strings in C.

The standard string library is quite bad when it comes to quality of life and security
of handling strings. This library is geared towards my personal tastes and use cases 
so it may not be ideal for everyone. 

This library is heavily untested, unfinished, and in active development, so use at your own risk. If you have any suggestions,
or encounter any issues, please be sure to open an issue on this repo. 

To see examples of how to use this library and its features, please refer to `test.c`.
